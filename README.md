# Automatic Machine Fault Detection and Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an automatic machine fault detection and recognition project using computer vision techniques. The project focuses on detecting and classifying faults such as Corona, Arcing, Looseness, and Tracking in industrial machines.

## Model Used
The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with dropout layers for fault detection and recognition. The CNN is trained on extracted features from visual data of machine components exhibiting various faults.

## Setup Instructions
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-machine-fault-detection.git`
2. Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure you have the necessary datasets and pretrained models in the appropriate directories.
4. Run the main script or Jupyter Notebook file to train the model and evaluate its performance.
